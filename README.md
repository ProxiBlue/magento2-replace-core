# Magento 2 removal of all optional core modules
This repository contains a composer meta-package that removes optional core modules. To install, use the following:

    composer require yireo/magento2-replace-core:2.3.4

This package and version support Magento 2.3.4.

## Specific notes for Magento 2.3.4
The following packages have been removed from replacement, due to pending bugs in Magento:

- `magento/module-message-queue` (removing this leads to AJAX errors in the checkout)
- `magento/module-persisent` (see https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/21614)

The Swatches modules have been removed from replacement, due to JS issues in the checkout:

- `magento/module-swatches`
- `magento/module-swatches-layered-navigation`
- `magento/module-swatches-graph-ql`

You could try to replace these packages with nothing in your custom project though.
